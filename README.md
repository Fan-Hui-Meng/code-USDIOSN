Code and Data of paper F. Meng et al., The universal spreading dynamics of information on online social networks.

This project provides the Python 3.6 and Matlab 2017 source code to fit the retweeting probability.
In both versions,  empirical data is also provided to feed into the fitting method.

Specifically, in the Python version, we provide code to show the empirical and fitted results for ten curves of retweeting probability.
To run the code, please refer to the 'README.md' file in the python directory.

In the Matlab version,  we also provide code to reproduce the above results.
Additionally, we provide an example to show the fitted results of three different Fitting Methods.
To run the code, please refer to the 'README.md' file in the matlab directory.

The rest of the code and data will be made publicly available after the acceptance of the paper.
